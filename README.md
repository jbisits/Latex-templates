# LaTeX templates

My $\LaTeX$ templates mainly for unsw related things.
The slides template is from [here](https://github.com/lsy3/beamer-unsw-theme) and the poster template is a modified version of [this one](https://github.com/RylanSchaeffer/Stanford-LaTeX-Poster-Template).
The posters are a three column landscape and two column portrait but can be changed.
